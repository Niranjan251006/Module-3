# Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the string `"google"` is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the string `"google"` to a variable.
2. Reverse the string manually using slicing (`[::-1]`).
3. Compare the original string with the reversed string.
   - If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
4. Execute the program.

```
string="google" 
if string==string[::-1]: 
   print ("The entered string is palindrome") else: 
   print ("The entered string is not palindrome")
```

## Output

![438646224-44f474c1-a570-4f1f-9aad-7562c8964e00](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c2c8c95-df35-4909-a505-9c9a0a6dd8e0)

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
